					You can't deny that you've thought about selling your business. You've thought about trading in your 60- or 70-hour weeks to retire and spend your days enjoying the wealth you've created. Or, maybe you're thinking about moving on to your next endeavor.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you've had these thoughts, but don't want to pay a business broker 10% of the sales price, ExitPlan.me is for you.

				<p>
					As the Baby Boomers retire, more than 70% of the 12 million privately-owned businesses are expected to change hands according to Cornell University economist Robert Avery. The time to sell your business is not after these businesses flood the market - it's before. It's now.
				</p>
				<p>
					It usually takes 9-12 months from start to sale, so don't wait until you absolutely must sell. When things get to that point, you're desperate and will sell for less than you would have if you had planned ahead.  Start the process today!

					Don't pay the '10% Broker Tax' on the sale of your business. With the simple, affordable pricing of ExitPlan.me, you'll save tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on broker commissions.  Since business brokers get paid on total sale prices, not just amount paid at closing, sellers pay commissions on an amount that includes real estate, inventory, and even seller financing!  With ExitPlan.me, a seller with a $500,000 business would save 70% in fees!

				<p>
					Let's face it. Selling your business, whether to retire or to pursue other business opportunities, is a huge life change. Change can be uncomfortable and the decision to sell isn't an easy one. But change is best when it happens on your terms, not someone else's. You don't want to have a broker dictate your selling experience &mdash; with ExitPlan.me, the sale of your business will happen on YOUR terms.
