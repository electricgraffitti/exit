					When you list your home for sale, you want everyone to know.  When it’s time to list your business, you don’t want anyone—not your customers, competitors, or employees—to know.  So we protect your confidentiality by requiring all prospective buyers to sign a non-disclosure agreement before receiving any information which could identify your business.

					When prospective buyers start inquiring, ExitPlan.me manages the initial correspondence to weed out the tire-kickers so that you can focus those most likely to buy your business. Once the serious buyers are identified and they've signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), the Confidential Business Review we've built for you will make your business stand out above others.
